Originaly designed as a typeface for the capital city of Bulgaria, Sofia Sans is a comprehensive type system in four widths with extended coverage of the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic Scripts.

Inspired by the early-twentieth-century so-called technical sans serifs typefaces with confident letterforms, a pronounced vertical impetus, and tense curves, Sofia Sans also has nice humanistic details and soft round corners that reminds print work with hot metal typesetting.

With narrow proportions and a generous x-height, is a space-saving workhorse that would work well in very diverse environments. Sofia Sans is also a feature-rich OpenType family with a large character set including small caps, several figure styles, arrows, numerals in circles among others.
